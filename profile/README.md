## 🌬️ When the Blade Finds Its Path

In the wind-laced arenas of **NARAKA: BLADEPOINT**, aim is not a dot on a screen—it is intention made visible. Blades arc, bows sing, grapples bite the air. The **NARAKA: BLADEPOINT Aim Assist** exists to steady that intention, to let your hand keep pace with your thought when the fight turns wild.

This is not noise layered over skill. It is a quiet alignment—subtle help where milliseconds decide the sentence.
